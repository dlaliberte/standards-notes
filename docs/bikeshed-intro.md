## Initial setup

[Domenic's guide to spec excellence - Docs](http://doc/1cRVD1k-hDBGfLVwTG14P_ZqJLM4d5-Z4vpwYFb_4qks#heading=h.qc07m2oa0jm)
(mostly tactical "how to start a new spec")
### Using GitHub.

Initially create an empty or mostly empty spec.bs file (e.g. [Minimal template](http://go/gh/WICG/starter-kit/blob/main/templates/index.bs)_), and associated files to automatically process updates to test the spec file and regenerate html.

See [Spec Prod Documentation](https://w3c.github.io/spec-prod/)

## Spec writing overviews

## Strategies for incremental development

If your API code already exists, and you have WebIDL specifications for that code, a great place to start is to copy in a subset of the WebIDL that corresponds to the public API.

After that, then you can add infra specs that reference the WebIDL specs.

## Starting Templates

Different types of APIs could have specs that follow different patterns.  Here is a list of several:

* [Sections template](http://go/gh/WICG/starter-kit/tree/main/templates)
* [Minimal template](http://go/gh/WICG/starter-kit/blob/main/templates/index.bs)
...

## Sample Full Specifications following Best Practices

* [Navigation API](https://wicg.github.io/navigation-api/)
* [Prioritized Task Scheduling](https://wicg.github.io/scheduling-apis/)
* [Close Watcher API](https://wicg.github.io/close-watcher/)

## Other Intros

A very helpful document, by Gary Kac, similar in purpose to this one:
