# Inbox

- Here you can write disorganized notes to be categorized later... or now.
- Bullet points are useful, but it could be free form text as well
- Sometimes it's better to just get things off your mind quickly, rather than stop to think where it belongs
- But don't let this list get too long
- Move information to more specific documents and link to them.
  - This helps you navigate between documents quickly
  - For example, you can`Cmd`+`Click` this: [[todo]]
- Some notes don't end up making sense the next day
- That's ok, you can just delete them!
  - You can always find them in your git history, if you really need it!

Random notes, mostly for myself.

Ambiguity

Analysing anaphoric ambiguity in natural language requirements
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225177725_Analysing_anaphoric_ambiguity_in_natural_language_requirements

In industrial practice, the vast majority of requirements documents are written in natural language and so run the risk of being ambiguous. … We aim to help requirements analysts to focus on identifying only those instances of ambiguity that are likely to lead to misunderstandings between stakeholders (because different stakeholders select different interpretations), while discounting those that are unlikely to cause misunderstandings (because all stakeholders choose the same interpretation).

Explainers include proposal?  

* Should it be just an "example" proposal or "suggested" proposal?
* How much detail in the proposal is too much?

Explainers don't include arguments for why we should NOT make some proposal?

Don't have sense of what is needed for a new feature.
Need guidance documents.
What needs to be written to fill gaps.
Owning a document for long term, requires a team, since individuals change over time.

How to deal with disagreement, and encourage agreement?

Does the user’s browser support a feature, versus does the user want to enable a feature?
Browser support for a feature could be inferred from the browser version, but UA-CH hopes to replace use of UA string with a large set of headers to identify the same features.  As all browsers eventually support some feature, is the UA-CH header for that feature useful any more?  Do we have to keep supporting all UA-CH headers forever?

Possible Chrome Status easy bugs:

[Generated Intent to Prototype emails are missing fields because I was never asked for them · Issue \#1691 · GoogleChrome/chromium\-dashboard](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chromium-dashboard/issues/1691)
  * Requires figuring out how to add to what is asked for I2P.  

[Tool does not match instructions for 'Web\-developer\-facing change to existing code \(PSA\)' · Issue \#1686 · GoogleChrome/chromium\-dashboard](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chromium-dashboard/issues/1686)
  * Potentially several complications.
  * Relevant to folding more docs into Chrome Status.

[Set up javascript unit tests · Issue \#1678 · GoogleChrome/chromium\-dashboard](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chromium-dashboard/issues/1678)
  * Seems easy enough for me, though there are several things I don't know about yet.
  * Relevant for testing potential client-side enhancements.

[Implement unit tests for django templates · Issue \#1677 · GoogleChrome/chromium\-dashboard](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chromium-dashboard/issues/1677)
  * Important, especially if I am going to modify django templates.

[Missing feedback when setting an item to approved · Issue \#1642 · GoogleChrome/chromium\-dashboard](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chromium-dashboard/issues/1642)
  * Seems simple and helpful.  Could be more complex depending on whether user action causes expected change visible in the page.
